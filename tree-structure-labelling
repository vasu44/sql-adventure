--I came across this question from https://quip.com/2gwZArKuWk7W. 

--I have used hierarchical  queries from oracle to solve this. https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_GQMLEEPG5ARVSIFGQRD3SES92.html

--Given a tree structure, we need to find the root node, leaf and Inner node.

| node |  parent |
| 1    |   2     | 
| 2    |   5     |
| 3    |   5     |
| 4    |   3     | 
| 5    |   NULL  | 


select
    node,
    parent,
    case when parent is null then 'Root'
    when connect_by_isleaf=1 then 'Leaf'
    else 'Inner' end label
from tree
start with parent is null
connect by prior node=parent;
